# Overview
The admin UI for Pinniped. For a Pinniped-backed project, only admins are allowed access to the contents of this dashboard.

The dashboard includes information about the database, schemas, and requests. Additionally, the admin UI can modify access control per table and execute CRUD operations.

The admin UI can be accessed upon running the core application at `/_/`. For example: `http://localhost:3000/_/`
